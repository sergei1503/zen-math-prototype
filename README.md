# Zen Math Prototype - Stone Counting Garden

A minimalist, contemplative approach to teaching math concepts through interactive visual exploration.

## Concept

**Stone Counting Garden** is a zen-inspired interactive experience where children explore mathematical concepts through arranging and grouping smooth stones in a virtual garden. No instructions, no scores, no pressure - just natural discovery of patterns and relationships.

## Learning Goals

- **Quantity recognition** without counting
- **Part-whole relationships** (5 stones = 3 + 2 = 4 + 1)
- **Grouping and ungrouping**
- **Conservation of number** (same amount, different arrangements)
- **Visual subitizing** (recognize small quantities instantly)

## Design Philosophy

- **Zen/Minimalist aesthetic** - Simple, beautiful, calming
- **Intuitive interaction** - No instructions needed, learn by exploring
- **Daoist approach** - Natural, flowing, discovers patterns through play
- **Engaging** - Must hold attention while building understanding

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` on iPad/tablet (or desktop browser for testing)
2. Let the child explore WITHOUT instructions
3. Watch them discover:
   - Stones can be dragged around
   - Stones close together naturally form groups
   - Groups can be split by dragging apart
   - Same quantity, infinite arrangements

## Testing with Your Daughter

### Setup
1. Load `index.html` on her iPad
2. Hand her the tablet
3. Say nothing (or just "try this")
4. Step back and observe

### What to Watch For
- ✅ Does she engage immediately?
- ✅ How long does she play?
- ✅ Does she discover grouping naturally?
- ✅ Does she experiment with different arrangements?
- ✅ Does she ask to play again?
- ⚠️ Does she ask for Toca Boca instead?

### Key Metrics
- **Engagement duration** (first session)
- **Return interest** (asks to play again?)
- **Learning observable** (groups/splits stones intentionally?)
- **Comparison** (zen learning vs dopamine-heavy games?)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Prototype loads and runs smoothly on tablet
- ✅ Daughter engages without needing explanation
- ✅ She plays for >5 minutes on first try
- ✅ Observable learning happening (intentional grouping/splitting)
- 🎯 **Ultimate test:** Does she ask to play again later?

## Technical Details

**Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
**Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas
**Interaction:** Touch-first, drag and drop
**Aesthetics:** Earth tones, organic shapes, smooth animations

## What This Is NOT

This is a **validation prototype**, not a production app. Goals:
1. Test core assumption: zen/minimalist learning can engage 6-year-old
2. Validate with real user (daughter) in real context (tablet)
3. Gather evidence before building full platform

## Next Steps (After Testing)

**If successful:**
- Talk to 3-5 other parents (Burning Man community?)
- Get feedback on concept
- Plan additional experiences (patterns, balance, etc.)
- Consider full platform architecture

**If unsuccessful:**
- Analyze why: aesthetics? interaction? concept?
- Iterate on prototype
- Test alternative approaches
- Or pivot to different solution

## Philosophy

> "The Dao that can be taught is not the eternal Dao"

Math concepts emerge naturally through play and exploration. No drilling, no pressure, just beautiful contemplative learning.
